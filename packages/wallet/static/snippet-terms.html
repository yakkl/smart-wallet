  <h2 id="7-fees" class="mt-2 font-bold">7. Fees</h2>
  <p class="mt-2">a. The fees for the Product and Services (“Fees”) are as set forth at yakkl.com or as otherwise communicated to you by YAKKL, and are subject to change by YAKKL from time to time. You agree to pay to YAKKL the then-current Fees for your usage of the Product and Services. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, all Fees are non-refundable.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">You may have the option to purchase prepaid credits (“Credits”) that may be redeemed to satisfy certain Fees that you may incur. The price for Credits, and details regarding the redemption of Credits to satisfy Fees, are as set forth at yakkl.com or as otherwise communicated by YAKKL, and are subject to change by YAKKL from time to time. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, all Credits are non-transferable and non-refundable, and shall expire one (1) year from the date of purchase. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, all Credits are non-transferable, non-refundable and have no cash value, and shall expire upon the earlier of (a) any expiration or termination of this Agreement, or (b) one (1) year from the date of purchase of the applicable Credits.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">b. YAKKL may, in its sole discretion, provide you with a limited free trial for the Product and/or certain Services. Any such free trial will be subject to usage limits and other restrictions as specified by YAKKL during your registration process, or as otherwise communicated by YAKKL from time to time. You acknowledge and agree that your access to and use of the Product or applicable Services may be suspended or terminated without notice if your free trial expires, or you exceed any such limits or restrictions.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">c. Except during a valid free trial as described above, you must maintain a valid payment mechanism on file with YAKKL in order to use the Product or Services. Accordingly, you may be asked to supply certain information. </p>
  <ul class="mt-1">
  <li>If paying via credit card you will supply your credit card number and its expiration date, and your billing address. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY PAYMENT CARD THAT YOU SUBMIT IN CONNECTION WITH A TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant to YAKKL the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating payments. Verification of information may be required before the acknowledgment or completion of any payment. By making a payment, you represent that the applicable Product or Services will be used only in a lawful manner. As part of receiving the Product or Services, you authorize YAKKL (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries, or other third parties) to request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund, or take any other billing actions) from our payment provider or your designated payment mechanism, and to make any inquiries YAKKL or its affiliates may consider necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from your payment, credit card, or banking account provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by your credit card company).</li>
  <li>If paying via Crypto currency you will supply account information and any other information required to initiate and/or approve payment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mt-2">d. Automatic Renewal. To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or PayPal, or crypto to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes. By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a one-year subscription for an advanced security plan, you&#39;ll be charged each year for access for another 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don&#39;t inadvertently disrupt your access to our Services. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you&#39;ve purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">To review renewal dates and manage subscriptions for any other Paid Services, please consult the respective Service&#39;s website portal or contact the support team. You&#39;ll need to check your email (including in spam or other filters) for any reminder emails we might send you before your Paid Services renew.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">e. Cancelling Automatic Renewal. You can manage and cancel any Paid Services at the respective Service&#39;s website portal.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">If auto-renew is successfully turned off, you&#39;ll see the date on which your subscription expires. If you have multiple Paid Services to cancel, repeat this process for each subscription.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">f. Fees and Changes. We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don&#39;t agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">g. No-Show Policy. We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services that require your participation. For instance, this may mean that if you don&#39;t show up or are late for a scheduled session or training, you&#39;ll still be charged and won&#39;t be entitled to a refund.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">h. Refunds. We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we&#39;ll also provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">i. The specified Fees and prices for Credits are exclusive of any federal, state, local or other taxes, and you will be solely responsible for such taxes;</p>
  <h2 id="8-term" class="mt-2 font-bold">8. Term</h2>
  <p class="mt-2">The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) begins on the Effective Date and continues until terminated in accordance with its terms. Unless mutually agreed otherwise in writing during the Term, you must stop accessing and using the Product and Services at the end of the Term.</p>
  <h2 id="9-termination" class="mt-2 font-bold">9. Termination</h2>
  <p class="mt-2">YAKKL may suspend or restrict your rights in or access to the Product or Services, or immediately terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part at any time and without prior notice, including if YAKKL reasonably believes that you have violated this Agreement, or if your use of the Product or Services exceeds reasonable usage as determined from time to time by YAKKL in its sole discretion.

Sections 2, 4, 6(a)–(c) and (f), 7 (with respect to any amounts accrued during the Term) and 8–18 will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">We may ask you to make adjustments, restrict the resources or terminate your access to the Services, if we believe your website&#39;s, application&#39;s, or API&#39;s bandwidth usage burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website or application is used by multiple sites or applications), or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">You can stop using our Services at any time, or, if you use a Paid Service, you can cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section of these Terms.</p>
