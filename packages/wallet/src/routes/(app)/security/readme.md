Protection methods:
Use long and unique passwords for every site and service. Storing them in encrypted form in a password manager synchronized across all your devices is highly convenient.

Use two-factor authentication with a USB key or mobile app wherever possible. SMS authentication is best avoided because of the possibility of interception.

Regularly check if your credentials have been exposed on the web from hacking or third-party service leaks.

All of the necessary functions for this are already included in a Kaspersky Premium subscription, which also contains the password manager:

Password Check warns you if your crypto passwords have been leaked online or are easy to crack and you may be vulnerable to identity hackers. Besides this, passwords are checked for compromise — if there were other users somewhere in the world with the same password, and it was hacked, you’ll know that this password is no longer secure. At the same time, your passwords themselves are not sent anywhere, and for their secure verification, the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing algorithm is used.

Data Leak Checker checks and informs you if your accounts are leaking personal data, like passwords or crypto wallet credentials, on both the internet and dark web.

Identity Protection Wallet stores your sensitive documents such as your passport or crypto wallet seed phrase in encrypted format in the cloud to prevent identity theft, and syncs them with all your devices.

Secret wallet converts your sensitive data like crypto credentials into an unreadable format and protects it with a password. Your data is securely encrypted on your device hard drive (locally, not in the cloud).
